## Technical Architecture

Cost Guardian is built on a modern, scalable architecture designed for performance, reliability, and extensibility.

### High-Level Architecture


### Core Components

#### Data Ingestion Layer

The data ingestion layer is responsible for collecting cost and usage data from multiple cloud providers. It employs:

- **Multi-threaded collection agents** for parallel data acquisition
- **Incremental sync mechanisms** to minimize API calls and data transfer
- **Adaptive rate limiting** to comply with provider-specific API constraints
- **Data validation pipeline** to ensure consistency and completeness
- **Fault-tolerant retry logic** with exponential backoff

```typescript
// Example of the data collector interface
interface CloudCostCollector {
  fetchCostData(
    startDate: Date, 
    endDate: Date, 
    granularity: TimeGranularity,
    dimensions?: CostDimension[]
  ): Promise<CostDataBatch>;
  
  validateBatch(batch: CostDataBatch): ValidationResult;
  
  transformToStandardFormat(
    providerData: ProviderSpecificFormat
  ): StandardCostFormat;
}
```

#### Data Processing Layer

The data processing layer transforms raw cost data into actionable information through:

- **Stream processing** for near real-time analysis
- **Batch processing** for historical analysis and complex aggregations
- **Cost allocation engine** that distributes shared costs based on configurable rules
- **Time series normalization** to account for billing cycles and time zone differences
- **Metadata enrichment** to add business context to technical resources

#### Storage Layer

Cost Guardian employs a multi-tiered storage strategy:

- **Hot storage** for recent and frequently accessed data (typically in-memory or fast NoSQL)
- **Warm storage** for medium-term data (typically columnar databases)
- **Cold storage** for historical archives (object storage with compression)
- **Time-series optimization** with automatic data downsampling for older periods

#### Analysis Engine

The heart of Cost Guardian's intelligence capabilities:

- **Statistical anomaly detection** using Z-scores, moving averages, and seasonal decomposition
- **Machine learning models** including LSTM networks for time series forecasting
- **Classification algorithms** to categorize spending patterns
- **Recommendation engine** with cost-benefit analysis for optimization suggestions
- **Natural language processing** for querying cost data in plain English

```python
# Simplified anomaly detection algorithm
def detect_anomalies(time_series_data, sensitivity=3.0):
    # Calculate moving average and standard deviation
    moving_avg = calculate_moving_average(time_series_data, window=7)
    moving_std = calculate_moving_std(time_series_data, window=7)
    
    # Apply seasonal decomposition to handle weekly/monthly patterns
    seasonal_components = seasonal_decompose(
        time_series_data, 
        model='multiplicative', 
        period=get_optimal_seasonality(time_series_data)
    )
    
    # Calculate normalized residuals
    normalized_residuals = (time_series_data - moving_avg) / moving_std
    
    # Identify anomalies
    anomalies = []
    for timestamp, value in enumerate(normalized_residuals):
        if abs(value) > sensitivity:
            confidence_score = calculate_confidence(
                value, 
                seasonal_components.resid[timestamp]
            )
            anomalies.append({
                'timestamp': timestamp,
                'value': time_series_data[timestamp],
                'deviation': value,
                'confidence': confidence_score
            })
    
    return anomalies
```

#### Visualization Layer

A sophisticated set of visualization components:

- **Interactive dashboards** with drill-down capabilities
- **Adaptive visualizations** that select optimal chart types based on data characteristics
- **Animation and transition effects** for enhanced user experience
- **Dynamic themeing** for white-labeling and custom branding
- **Export capabilities** for reports, presentations, and data analysis

#### API Layer

RESTful and GraphQL APIs with:

- **Hierarchical resource modeling** for intuitive navigation
- **Cursor-based pagination** for efficient data traversal
- **Hypermedia controls** (HATEOAS) for discoverable interfaces
- **Comprehensive filtering, sorting, and search capabilities**
- **Fine-grained access controls** with scope-based permissions

  month        Int
  day          Int
  
  @@index([timestamp])
  @@index([provider, account])
  @@index([service])
  @@index([year, month])
}

model Anomaly {

  timestamp       DateTime
  costEntryId     String
  deviationScore  Float
  confidenceScore Float

  id               String   @id @default(uuid())
  name             String
  amount           Float
  currency         String
  startDate        DateTime
  endDate          DateTime
  recurrence       String?  // MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, ANNUAL
  scope            Json     // Which accounts, services, etc. this budget applies to
  currentSpend     Float
  forecastedSpend  Float
  alertThresholds  Json     // e.g., {50: true, 80: true, 90: true, 100: true}
  alertDestinations Json     // Where to send alerts (email, Slack, webhook)
  
  @@index([startDate, endDate])
}
```
